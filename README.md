Code for generating results in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.00088.pdf

Just a collection of the files and data used to generate the figures in the paper.  Should be possible to just clone the repository and run process_images.py to obtain the images in the paper.  

The beam parameters (like waist size) used for the simulated profiles are presented in process_images.py
